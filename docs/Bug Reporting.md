# Effective Bug Reporting
Before opening any issues on the bug tracker, use the search feature to locate any potential duplicates or related issues. If you find any matches, update the existing issue if you have additional relevant information that could help the developers in resolving the bug.

If you have a new bug to report, please ensure that you include the following information at a minimum:
* The server or game patch that your issue pertains to (e.g. Anathema, patch 1.10).
* A clear, concise description of the current behaviour.
* A description of the expected behaviour.
* Where applicable, provide relevant sources that show or describe the correct behaviour.

### Sources
Any links that you can provide that demonstrate that the information in your bug report will go a long way to helping the developers fix the problem. Although finding data from over a decade ago can be tricky, there are still avenues that are worth exploring.
* The official patch notes are usually the first port of call for finding evidence of game mechanic and item changes. However, many changes will not be documented.
* Through searching, you can often find lists of unofficial patch notes that document changes that were not detailed in the official notes.
* Using relevant keywords in Google while restricting the time range will often find old, useful forum posts that describe mechanics/boss strategies.
* YouTube and Warcraftmovies can be a good source of old gameplay recordings.
* Make good use of the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to browse older data mining website such as Thottbot and Allakhazam. You may also be able to find some content on archived versions of ElitistJerks.
* WoW BlueTracker (http://blue.cardplace.com/search.html) contains a wealth of older blue posts that can often by useful for finding evidence of various minor changes and mechanic hotfixes.
* Wikis can be a good source of information if all else fails. Try looking through the edit history of relevant articles to find evidence.

In general, private servers and forums posts from their communities are not considered to be a reliable source of information.
